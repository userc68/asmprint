## Wow does inline assembly syntax suck <br>
anyways i saw a video where this guy makes his own malloc, so i made my own printf. <br>
### How to use

```c
// inlcude asmp.h header file
#include "asmp.h"

int main() {
  // call asmprint or asmprintln to print
  // asmprint does not append a newline to the end
  // asmprintln does
  asmprintln("Hello, World!");
  return 0;
}
```
